# ## 1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

# In[1]:


# boolean data type only return two type value either True or False or we say 1 for true and 0 for false
a=0
b=7
c=b<a
print(c)
print(type(c))
d=bool(a) # type conversion "integer into bool"
print(d, type(d))


# ## 2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

# In[2]:


# 'and','or' ,not are the three boolean operators
a=5
b=7
if a>0 and b<0:                      # each condition are true then it become true in 'and ' operator  
    print('lie in second quadrant'
else:
    print('not lie in second quadrant')
          


# In[ ]:


a=5
b=7
if a>b or b<10:    # if any one condition is true then it become true in "or " operator
    print('true')
else:
    print('false')


# In[ ]:


a=5
b=7
if not(a<b):               # 'not' operator change the result i.e true into false and false into true
    print('true')
else:
    print('false')


# ## 3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

# In[ ]:


'''  truth table of 'and' operator NOTED: '0' for false and '1' for true
x   y   x and y
0   0     0
0   1     0
1   0     0
1   1     1

     truth table of 'or'
x   y    x or y
0   0      0
1   0      1
0   1      1
1   1      1

# ## 5. What are the six comparison operators?

# In[ ]:


'''
1. Less than (<)

2. Greater than (>)

3. Less than or equal to (<=)

4. Greater than or equal to (>=)

5. Equal to (==)

6. Not equal to (!=)

# ## 6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.

# In[ ]:


# '==' use for compare two value
#  '=' use for assigning the value
a=3+2        # sum of 3 and 2 is assigned to variable 'a

# spam = 0
# 
# if spam == 10:
# 
# print(&#39;eggs&#39;)

# if spam &gt; 5:
#

# ## 8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

# In[10]:


spam=int(input('enter the integer '))

# ## 9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

# '''
# In general, typing Control+C cannot be counted on to interrupt a running Python program.
# 
# Depending on what is happening in your loop:
# 
# 1) Canopy's Run menu > Interrupt kernel (for most simple programs, this will work)
# 
#                            or
#                            
# 2) Run menu > Restart kernel
# 
#                             or
# 
# 3) Quit Canopy, then restart it

# ## 10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

# In[19]:


# 'break ' statement is use to break the loop and come out
for i in range(10):
    sum=0
    sum = sum +i
    if sum == 8:
        print('time to break')
        break
print(sum)      
    


# In[20]:


# 'continue' statement that force to execute next iteration and skip  for current iteration
for i in 'hello world':
    if i=='w': # when 'i' will be going to 'w' then loop is continue and below print statement skip for current iteration
        continue
    print(i)   
        
        
    
    


# ## 11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

# In[29]:


for i in range(10):
    print(i)    # 12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop. value print from 0 to 10 and 10 is exclude
print('\n')    
for j in range(0,10):
    print(j)             # here starting  given i.e 0 and ending  is 10
print("\n")    
for k in range(0,10,1):
       print(k)           # here a skipping given i.e 1   with starting 0 and ending 10  
        


# ## 12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

# In[31]:


for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

# ## 13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

# In[32]:


# understand with example
import math 
a=math.pow(2,3)  # math is module and pow() is funcion
print(a)
    # so we call bacon() function by 'spam.bacon()'
